# Reports

The reports which come out of the box provide a wide variety of information regarding your Sitecore installation.

We've built quite a few reports, many similar to the [Advanced System Report][1] (ASR) module.

#### Running a Report

As an example, let's run the Unused media items report.

Once the report completes, the results appear in a report window.

#### Reports in SPE similar to ASR

While SPE contains many reports, they don't match identical to ASR reports. We've done our best to build those that seem most relevant or likely to be used. If you find a report in ASR that you would like to exist in SPE please submit a request.
