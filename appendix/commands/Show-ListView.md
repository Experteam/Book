# Show-ListView 
 
Sends output to an interactive table in a separate window. 
 
## Syntax 
 
Show-ListView [-PageSize &lt;Int32&gt;] [-Icon &lt;String&gt;] [-InfoTitle &lt;String&gt;] [-InfoDescription &lt;String&gt;] [-Modal] [-ActionData &lt;Object&gt;] [-ViewName &lt;String&gt;] [-MissingDataMessage &lt;String&gt;] [-ActionsInSession] -Data &lt;Object&gt; [-Property &lt;Object[]&gt;] [-Title &lt;String&gt;] [-Width &lt;Int32&gt;] [-Height &lt;Int32&gt;] 
 
 
## Detailed Description 
The Show-ListView cmdlet sends the output from a command to a grid view window where the output is displayed in an interactive table.
Because this cmdlet requires a user interface, it does not work in a non-interactive scenarios like within web service calls.
You can use the following features of the table to examine your data:
-- Sort. To sort the data, click a column header. Click again to toggle from ascending to descending order.
-- Quick Filter. Use the "Filter" box at the top of the window to search the text in the table. You can search for text in a particular column, search for literals, and search for multiple words.
-- Execute actions on selected items. To execute action on the data from Show-ListView, Ctrl+click the items you want to be included in the action and press the desired action in the "Actions" chunk in the ribbon.
-- Export contents of the view in XML, CSV, Json, HTML or Excel file and download that onto the user's computer. The downloaded results will take into account current filter and order of the items.

## Examples 
 
### EXAMPLE 1 
 
This command formats information about Sitecore items in a table. The Get-ChildItem cmdlet gets objects representing the items. 
The pipeline operator (|) passes the object to the Show-ListView command. Show-ListView displays the objects in a table. 
 
```powershell   
 
PS master:\> Get-Item -path master:\* | Show-ListView -Property Name, DisplayName, ProviderPath, TemplateName, Language 
 
``` 
 
### EXAMPLE 2 
 
This command formats information about Sitecore items in a table. The Get-ItemReferrer cmdlet gets all references of the "Sample Item" template. 
The pipeline operator (|) passes the object to the Show-ListView command. Show-ListView displays the objects in a table.
The Properties are not displaying straight properties but use the Name/Expression scheme to provide a nicely named values that 
like in the case of languages which are aggregarde form the "Languages" property. 
 
```powershell   
 
PS master:\> Get-ItemReferrer -path 'master:\templates\Sample\Sample Item' | 
                 Show-ListView -Property `
                     @{Label="Name"; Expression={$_.DisplayName} }, 
                     @{Label="Path"; Expression={$_.Paths.Path} }, 
                     @{Label="Languages"; Expression={$_.Languages | % { $_.Name + ", "} } } 
 
```
