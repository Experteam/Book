# Training

Sitecore PowerShell Extensions module has so much to offer, but sometimes those new to the module may find it difficult to know where to start. The following book should provide you with enough information to use and be productive with SPE. 

Don't worry, you will be able to use it without having to write any code.

## Training Material

We have a video series available to help walk you through the module [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLph7ZchYd_nCypVZSNkudGwPFRqf1na0b).

We also maintain a comprehensive list of links to [blogs and videos](https://blog.najmanowicz.com/sitecore-powershell-console/) to help you on your journey to SPE awesomeness. Happy coding!
