# Installation

The SPE module installs just like any other Sitecore module. 

Download the module from the [Sitecore Marketplace][1] and install through the _Installation Wizard_.

Immediately following the installation you'll find these new items added to the Sitecore menu:
* Sitecore -> PowerShell Console
* Sitecore -> PowerShell Toolbox
* Sitecore -> Development Tools -> PowerShell ISE
* Sitecore -> Reporting Tools -> PowerShell Reports
