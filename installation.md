# Installation

The SPE module installs just like any other Sitecore module. 

1. Download the module from the [Sitecore Marketplace](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/Sitecore_PowerShell_console.aspx) and install through the _Installation Wizard_.

Immediately following the installation you'll find these new items added to the Sitecore menu:
1. Sitecore -> PowerShell CLI
2. Sitecore -> Toolbox
3. Sitecore -> Development Tools -> PowerShell ISE
4. Sitecore -> Reporting Tools -> PowerShell Reports
