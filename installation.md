# Installation

The SPE module installs just like any other Sitecore module, through the Installation Wizard. 

Immediately following the installation you'll find these new items added to the menu:
1. Sitecore -> PowerShell CLI
2. Sitecore -> Toolbox
3. Sitecore -> Development Tools -> PowerShell ISE
