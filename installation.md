# Installation

The SPE module installs just like any other Sitecore module. 

Download the module from the [Sitecore Marketplace](https://marketplace.sitecore.net/Modules/Sitecore_PowerShell_console.aspx) and install through the _Installation Wizard_.

Immediately following the installation you'll find these new items added to the Sitecore menu:
* Sitecore -> PowerShell CLI
* Sitecore -> Toolbox
* Sitecore -> Development Tools -> PowerShell ISE
* Sitecore -> Reporting Tools -> PowerShell Reports
