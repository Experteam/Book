# Authoring Reports

Building reports is a straightforward task. We've provided a variety of examples for you to model when designing your own. 

#### Dynamic Reports

The **Authorable Reports** module includes reports such as *Index Viewer* and *Rules based report* that provide input dialogs to help make the reports dynamic. 

**Examples:**
* Turn Your Sitecore Powershell Reports into Applications with Action Scripts


#### Static Reports

The **Content Reports** module includes other reports used for auditing. Below are some examples on how to create your own.

**Examples:**
 * [Images with an empty alt field][1]
 * [Unused media items][2]
