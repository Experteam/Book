# Authoring Reports

Building reports is a straightforward task. We've provided a variety of examples for you to model when designing your own. 

The **Authorable Reports** module includes reports such as *Index Viewer* and *Rules based report* that provide input dialogs to help make the reports dynamic. 

Some other reports used for auditing are included in the **Content Reports** module. Below are some examples on how to create your own.

**Examples:**
 * [Images with an empty alt field][1]
 * [Unused media items][2]
