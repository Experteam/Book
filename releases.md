* You might want to check how your scripts behave for users in other languages as we're now setting the context language on the Job, which e.g. impacts how items are retrieved. \[694\]
* All remotely accessible services are now disabled by default [716](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/716) so you need to provide a patch config file if you want to use SPE in your CI environment out-of-the-box.

## Version 4.0

A lot of hard work went into this release. Wasn't released as soon as we hoped, but we are certain many of you will be pleased with the results. Happy coding!

[Full issue list available on GitHub](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A4.0) - 90+ issues.

### Summary of important changes

#### Breaking Changes

* The `Rebuild-SearchIndex` command now returns an existing job [558](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/558) for an index if currently rebuilding.
* Request related variables such as `$HttpContext` are no longer added to the session [557](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/557) but can still be accessed through their static context properties.
* The `Publish-Item` command now supports the additional publishing options [539](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/539) introduced in Sitecore 7.1. The default behavior was changed to synchronous and requires the `AsJob` parameter to run asynchronously.
* The `Add-ItemLanguage` and `Remove-ItemLanguage` commands were renamed [532](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/532) to `Add-ItemVersion` and `Remove-ItemVersion` since item versions and languages are managed almost the same.
* The user management commands received an adjustment [520](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/520) [498](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/498) [497](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/497) in which `New-Role` no longer requires `-Passthru` to output the resulting account. Also, the `Remove-User` command now accepts the `User` object as input.
* User reported [511](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/511) that SPE conflicted with the **InSite Commerce** product due to the 2.x services location so we went ahead and broke compatibility.
* Some users have encountered items with multiple fields of the same name [575](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/575) so we changed the behavior by prefixing the name with and underscore recurrently to disambiguate them.
* Stop using `$PSScriptRoot` and `$PSCommandPath` and start using `$SitecoreScriptRoot` and `$SitecoreCommandPath` [588](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/588).

#### New Features

* A new Experience Button integration point was added [546](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/546).
* Method signature in the ISE received a face lift [541](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/541). Now you can see the argument data types!
* Type names now autocomplete [540](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/540).
* SPE Remoting now supports uploading large files [528](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/528).
* Rebuilding the index for single items is now possible [523](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/523) with `Rebuild-SearchIndexItem` and removing with `Remove-SearchIndexItem`.
* Added a report [513](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/513) for unpublished items in one or more targets.
* Users can now peek the session variable values by way of a tooltip [495](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/495).
* The ISE now shows when a script is modified or not yet saved [458](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/458).
* New variable `$SitecoreAuthority` is initialized with the site hostname [591](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/591).

#### Enhancements

* We went crazy on the styling of the console windows so now you can [565](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/565) configure the foreground and background colors. The `Show-Result` command also retains [566](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/566) the colors of the host session.
* Variables are now hidden from the autocomplete [560](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/560) unless the token begins with a `$`.
* The `ScriptSession` now contains a property _LastErrors_ [559](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/559) that contains the errors encountered in a script rather than cluttering the log.
* The `Publish-Item` command suggests database names [553](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/553) and _filesystem_ is no longer an option.
* The export command in reports no longer require a temporary file [551](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/551). This should now add support in hosted environments such as Azure [549](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/549)[529](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/529).
* The `Show-ListView` command now enumerates collections [544](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/544) rather than printing the class name.
* The `UseDefaultCredentials` parameter is now supported [531](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/531) when using the `New-ScriptSession` command in SPE Remoting.
* The `Publish-Item` command will not publish to all targets by default [530](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/530) without requiring the target to be specified.
* Some of the UI elements using `Show-ListView` can be hidden when using the _Hide_ parameter [521](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/521).
* Your favorite commands `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem` now have [519](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/519) tab completion on the `-Language` and `-Database` parameters.
* SPE Remoting supports `$using:[variablename]` in the scriptblock [499](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/499).
* Changed the behavior of `Add-ItemLanguage` so that it outputs the existing latest version if it exists [578](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/578).
* Sometimes you need to grant Acls for System Roles like _Everyone_ and _Creator-Owner_ so we've updated  [596](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/596) [595](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/595) our security commands like `Get-Role` and `New-ItemAcl` to support that scenario.
* `ScriptSession` can now load type info without the need for `Set-ExecutionPolicy` changes [590](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/590).
* The Live Autocomplete feature when typing was so powershell we decided to allow you to enable or disable [584](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/584).
* Save time with `Get-ChildItem` by using the `-WithParent` parameter [580](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/580).
* Specifying the `ProfileItemId` when using `New-User` is now possible through [573](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/573).
* Downloading a file is a little more secure as the download form displayed by `Send-File` hides the file path by default. You can however still show it with `-ShowFullPath` switch [568](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/568).

#### Fixes

* The SPE Remoting commands `Send-RemoteItem` and `Receive-RemoteItem` now use `Write-Error` when an error is encountered [564](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/564).
* The `Show-Result` command was not adhering to the font settings [552](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/552).
* The `GetItemWorkflowEvent` command threw exceptions for missing optional parameters [545](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/545).
* Automatic properties no longer require a restart to update [534](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/534).
* Creating new branch items now respects [577](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/577) the specified language.
* Adam was going crazy trying to resolve an issue [579](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/579) where `Set-Layout` wasn't working. We think he's better now and the doctor released him from the clinic.
* * Through SPE Remoting you are now able to cleanup background `ScriptSessions` through the use of `Stop-ScriptSession` [594](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/594) [593](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/593).
* Users with more restricted access caused an issue with function caching [592](https://github.com/SitecorePowerShell/Console/issues/592).
