### Experience Button

The *Experience Button* integration adds a button to the Page Editor and is aware of the interactive rules. The script is only executed when the button is clicked.

1. Begin by adding a new script to the *Experience Button* library. The name of the script will appear in the tooltip.
2. Edit the script to perform the appropriate actions. The script can run in the background and show dialogs.
3. Change the icon of the item to match the script purpose.
4. Configure the rules to control visibility and enablement.
