![logo](images/logos/logo-45x45.jpg) Sitecore PowerShell Extensions
=======

The [Sitecore PowerShell Extensions][1] (SPE) module is one of the best ways to manage and extend Sitecore. The module includes a command line (CLI) and scripting environment (ISE) for automating a variety tasks.

By no means is this book a complete and authoritative guide to all things SPE, but we sure hope to provide you enough to be effective.

We've also maintained a fairly comprehensive list of links to [blogs and videos][2] to help you on your journey to SPE awesomeness. Happy coding!
