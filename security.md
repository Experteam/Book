# Security

#### Security Policies

There are two main security policies to consider when using the SPE module:
* Application Pool service account
* Sitecore user account

##### Application Pool Service Account

The first policy relates to the Application Pool service account running in IIS. The Windows PowerShell runspace will have access to the local system via providers (i.e. FileSystem, Registry), and be managed through the Console or ISE. If the service account is capable of removing files from the root directory, then SPE can accomplish the same.

##### Sitecore User Account

The second policy is tied to the Sitecore user account. The code executed through SPE operates within the privileges of the logged in user. Keep in mind that this can be bypassed just as can be through the Sitecore API.
