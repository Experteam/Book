# Modules

Sitecore PowerShell Extensions provides a way to organize your scripts into *modules*. 

Some benefits to using modules:
* You can enable or disable the module as needed. For this to take full affect the integration should be rebuilt in the ISE.
* The out-of-the-box scripts are in their own module.
