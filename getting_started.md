# Getting Started

The SPE module works with the Sitecore process, capable of making native calls to the Sitecore API. Running commands and writing scripts follow the standard and well-known Windows PowerShell syntax. You may be wondering why Windows PowerShell was chosen as the command line tool. Windows desktop and server management is quickly moving towards the use of Windows PowerShell. There are tons of resources on the usage of Windows PowerShell, so once you begin to learn the basics youâ€™ll immediately be able to apply those skills to manage applications such as Microsoft Active Directory, Microsoft Exchange, and now of course Sitecore!

As you read through this guide we hope that your understanding of both Sitecore and Windows PowerShell is strengthened.
