# Console

The SPE Console is a command line interface \(CLI\) designed for efficiency. The console provides a streamlined tool for working with Windows PowerShell and Sitecore. The default configuration for SPE requires the Console to be in an [Elevated Session State](../security/) before allowing the execution of commands.

The following figure shows the Console when the User Account Controls \(UAC\) are disabled. While this is a common configuration for developers, we highly encourage you to ensure UAC is enabled in higher environments.
